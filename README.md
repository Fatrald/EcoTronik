## Background of Project
As the world becomes increasingly dependent on electronic devices, the amount of electronic waste (e-waste) generated is growing at an alarming rate. Out of a total of 2 million tons of electronic waste recorded by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in 2021. In fact, only around 17.4% have been managed properly. The rest is still stored at home or goes into landfills and mixed with other types of waste. Disposal of e-waste in landfills poses a serious threat to the environment and human health due to the presence of toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. Recycling e-waste is crucial for reducing the environmental impact and conserving valuable resources. However, the lack of awareness and easy access to e-waste recycling services remains a significant challenge. In this context, there is a need for a user-friendly and efficient e-waste recycling application that can connect users with nearby recycling facilities and provide information on the proper disposal and handling of e-waste. üçÄ

## Project Scope
We work collaboratively to produce a final project with the scope below :
 * Developing the Ecotronik application as a mobile app that can be used as a place for electronic waste disposal for the community so that electronic waste does not have a negative impact on the environment
 * The machine learning team will utilize the Tensorflow library to develop a Neural Network design that can classify different types of electronic waste. Additionally, they will employ data scraping techniques to get the necessary datasets for training the model.
 * The Mobile Development team will be responsible for designing the user interface (UI) for the application and integrating it into the Android platform. They will also finalize the application by incorporating an API endpoint from the Cloud, which includes a dataset of electronic waste and a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model.
 * The Cloud Computing team will establish a cloud service infrastructure to deploy the machine learning model on an AI Platform. They will utilize cloud SQL and cloud storage to store various types of data, including electronic waste and user data. Additionally, they have developed a REST API application to facilitate data communication between different components of the system.
